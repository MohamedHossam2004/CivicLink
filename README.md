CivicLink is a mobile application designed to foster seamless communication and interaction between citizens and their local government. The platform aims to organize and enhance civic life by providing a centralized hub for announcements, community feedback, problem reporting, and local information.
It features three distinct roles: Citizens, a single Government Admin, and Advertisers, each with a tailored set of functionalities.
